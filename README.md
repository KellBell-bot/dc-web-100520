# dc-web-100520

## Welcome to Flatiron!  

### This repo will hold *all* your lecture code for your 15 weeks here.  *Clone this entire repo to your computer.  DO NOT FORK IT* .  

#### To get the code the first time onto your own computer:

In your terminal, navigate to a folder on your computer where you want to store the lecture code. 

- `git clone git@github.com:learn-co-students/dc-web-100520.git`

This will create a folder called dc-web-100520.


#### To get new code after a lecture, go to the lecture directory you created above 
- `cd dc-web-100520`
- `git pull`

If you are typing your own code in this folder during lecture, you will need to either `commit` or `stash` your code

  - If you have notes you want to save:
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "my notes for the lecture"`
    - `git pull`
  - If you don't want to save your work and just want the lecture code:
    - `git stash`
    - `git pull`
    
**Please ask if you have any questions!**
